            <h3>History</h1>
          <p>
            A trading card (or collectible card) is a small card, typically made
            of paperboard or thick paper, that features an image of a person,
            place, thing (real or fictional), and often includes a brief
            description, along with other information such as statistics,
            trivia, or gameplay elements. When sold or exchanged individually,
            they are referred to as singles. While trading cards are most
            commonly associated with sports, particularly baseball cards, they
            also cover a wide range of subjects. These can include non-sport
            topics like Pok√©mon, cartoons, comic book characters, and stills
            from television shows and films. In the 1990s, a new category of
            trading cards emerged: collectible card games. These cards are
            specifically designed for game-playing, often with fantasy-based
            themes and mechanics. Fantasy art cards, a subgenre, focus on
            showcasing artwork, often linked to fantasy settings or themes.

        <h3>Origin</h2>
     <p>Trade cards originated as promotional items inserted into cigarette packs to advertise products. The first tobacco companies to print them were <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_%26_Ginter">Allen and Ginter</a>  in 1886 (U.S.) and <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.D._%26_H.O._Wills">W.D. & H.O. Wills</a>    in 1888 (UK). These cards featured a variety of topics, from nature to sports, appealing to male consumers. By 1900, thousands of tobacco card sets were produced. Afterward, other manufacturers created trade cards for their products. World War II halted cigarette card production, and post-war, collectors shifted to tea cards in the UK and bubble gum cards in the U.S. as the new collectibles.</p>

<h3>Digital Trading Cards 

</h3>
<p>
    
To adapt to technological advancements, trading card companies began exploring digital cards, either as exclusive digital products or as counterparts to physical cards. In 1995, Michael A. Pace introduced "computer-based" cards on CD-ROMs. In 2000, Topps launched etopps, a sports card brand sold online, while Tokenzone launched a digital collectibles platform. Topps discontinued eTopps in 2012.

By 2013, the digital collectible card game market was worth $1.3 billion, with start-ups like Stampii, Fantom, Deckdaq, and 2Stic emerging. Panini introduced Adrenalyn XL for NBA and NFL cards, and mytcg Technologies offered a platform for digital collections. Legal issues arose in 2011 when Wildcat Intellectual Property Holdings sued several companies, including Topps and Panini. That year, Topps also launched the Topps Bunt app for trading digital player cards. In 2015, Topps introduced Marvel Hero Attax as a digital extension of its physical cards

<h3>Value
     </h3>
     <p>The rise of the internet has fostered online communities where collectors trade cards, often through platforms like eBay. Websites also offer "sell to us" options to attract sales. Singles are generally more valuable than bulk or personal collections, with collectible card games (CCGs) often commanding higher prices due to their dual function as both games and collectibles. CCG prices can fluctuate depending on legal status in tournaments.

        Card value is influenced by condition, popularity, and rarity. Older cards can be worth significantly more, although many sports cards have seen less appreciation due to overproduction. Limited editions and small print runs can boost value, but ultimately, a card is worth what a collector is willing to pay. The global sports trading card market, valued at $44 billion, is expected to reach $100 billion by 2027.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: left;    ">Condition</h3>
            
           <p style="text-align: left;">Card condition is a crucial factor in determining the value of a trading card. The condition is evaluated based on four main areas: centering, corners, edges, and surface. Imperfections, such as color spots, blurred images, creases, scratches, and tears, are considered when assessing a card's condition. Cards are typically graded on a scale from poor to pristine or assigned a numeric rating from 1 to 10. For instance, a card in pristine condition will usually be valued higher than one in poor condition. Major grading companies like PSA, Beckett, and SGC provide these ratings, offering individual grades for centering, corners, edges, and surface, which are then combined to form a final grade. Older cards are often more susceptible to wear, so a grade of '7' may reduce the value of a 2018 card, but could significantly increase the value of a 1950s card. While the grade plays a key role in value, the card's population also impacts its worth. For example, there are over 20,000 PSA 10 graded Luka Doncic 2018 Base Prizm cards, and the high population drives down the value of each card.</p>
